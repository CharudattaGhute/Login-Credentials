# Login-Credentials
This React application provides a simple implementation of a signup and login system. The project consists of two main components:

## Signup Page

The **Signup Page** allows users to register for an account by providing their email and password. It includes a basic form for user input and utilizes React state to manage the form data. The signup functionality can be extended to interact with a backend server for user registration.
## Login Page

The **Login Page** enables registered users to log in using their credentials. Similar to the signup page, it features a form for user input and employs React state for managing the login process. You can customize the login logic to interact with a backend server for authentication.
